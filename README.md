# Introduction
The objective of the project is to develop a multi-threaded application server for PHP, written in PHP. Yes, pure PHP! You think we aren't serious? Maybe! But we think, in order to enable as many developers in our great community, this will be the one and only way. So with your help we hopefully establish a solution as the standard for enterprise applications in PHP environments.
